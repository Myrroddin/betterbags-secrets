# BetterBags - Secrets
Plugin module for the World of Warcraft AddOn [BetterBags](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/better-bags) that sorts items used for secrets into BetterBags virtual groups

## World of Warcraft Supported Versions

- Mainline or retail. Currently, that is Dragonflight

## Supported Items
The full list can be [viewed online](https://github.com/Myrroddin/betterbags-secrets/blob/main/Database.lua) or with any text editor. I suggest [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) which will maintain the readability of Database.lua when opening the file directly from the AddOn folder.
